# Docs

This is documentation for everything I ever needed for programming...

There is a folder languages, with language specific commands, snippets, examples etc...

There is file `documentation.md` that describes operating system helpers, syntax for terminals, git, docker etc.

It's open of course, you can use it, share it and edit it...

## Printscreen

This is an example of how it can look in IDE
